# Discover Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS. It offers a highly customizable, responsive, and modern approach to styling web applications.

## Key Features

- **Utility-First**: Tailwind provides a wide range of utility classes for common CSS properties like margin, padding, color, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Easily create responsive designs with Tailwind's built-in responsive utilities.
- **Customization**: Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing you to configure your design system and extend the framework with your own utilities, components, and plugins.
- **Performance**: Tailwind's approach to styling can lead to smaller CSS bundles and improved performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tailwind CSS, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Then, create a `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Add Tailwind's directives to your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Finally, build your CSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o dist/styles.css
```

## Example

Here's a simple example of a responsive card component using Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
  <img class="w-full" src="img/card-top.jpg" alt="Sunset in the mountains" />
  <div class="px-6 py-4">
    <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptatibus
      quia, nulla! Maiores et perferendis eaque, exercitationem praesentium
      nihil.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
    <span
      class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2"
      >#photography</span
    >
    <span
      class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2"
      >#travel</span
    >

    >
