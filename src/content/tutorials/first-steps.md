# First Steps with CSS

Welcome to your first steps in learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)! CSS is a powerful tool for controlling the look and feel of your web pages. This guide will help you get started with the basics.

## What is CSS?

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows you to separate content from design, making your web pages more flexible and easier to maintain.

## Adding CSS to Your HTML

There are three ways to add CSS to your HTML documents:

1. **Inline CSS**: Using the `style` attribute within HTML tags.

   ```html
   <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
   ```

2. **Internal CSS**: Using the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML document.

   ```html
   <head>
     <style>
       p {
         color: blue;
       }
     </style>
   </head>
   ```

3. **External CSS**: Linking to an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag.
   ```html
   <head>
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
   </head>
   ```

## Basic CSS Syntax

CSS rules are made up of selectors and declarations. A selector targets the HTML element you want to style, and declarations define the styles to be applied.

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

Example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

## Common CSS Properties

- **Color**: Sets the color of text.

  ```css
  color: red;
  ```

- **Font-size**: Sets the size of the font.

  ```css
  font-size: 20px;
  ```

- **Margin**: Sets the space outside an element.

  ```css
  margin: 10px;
  ```

- **Padding**: Sets the space inside an element.

  ```css
  padding: 10px;
  ```

- **Background-color**: Sets the background color of an element.
  ```css
  background-color: yellow;
  ```
